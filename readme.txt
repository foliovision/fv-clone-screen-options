== Description ==

Simple plugin which lets you manage Screen Options of all the users on your blog.

First set your own Screen Options and then **clone them across all users** with our plugin.

A huge time saver. Enjoy!

Note: Multisite is not supported very well, plugin doesn't distinguish between individual blogs.
